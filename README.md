Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project predicts the selling price of used cars based on key features like brand, year, engine, fuel type, and more.
It uses machine learning regression techniques to analyze data, clean it, and train a predictive model that estimates car prices with accuracy.
Objectives
•	Predict car prices using machine learning models.
•	Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
•	Compare model performance and visualize results.
•	Understand how regression works in real-world applications like price prediction.
Dataset
•	Source: Kaggle - Car Price Prediction (Used Cars)
•	The dataset contains information such as:
o	name – Car model and brand
o	year – Year of manufacture
o	selling_price – Actual price (target variable)
o	km_driven – Distance driven
o	fuel, seller_type, transmission, owner – Categorical features
o	mileage, engine, max_power, seats – Performance-related attributes
 Technologies Used
•	Language: Python
•	Libraries:
o	pandas – Data handling
o	numpy – Numerical computations
o	matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
o	scikit-learn – Machine learning (training, testing, evaluation)
 Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
•	Load dataset with Pandas.
•	Handle missing values.
•	Remove symbols like “kmpl”, “bhp”, and “CC” from numeric columns.
•	Convert data types for numerical analysis.
•	Encode categorical variables using Label Encoding.
2️⃣ Feature Engineering
•	Log-transform target variable (selling_price) for better model performance.
•	Drop redundant columns like name and torque (if present).
3️⃣ Model Training
•	Split dataset into training and testing sets (80/20).
•	Train multiple regression models:
o	Linear Regression
o	Random Forest Regressor
o	Decision Tree Regressor
4️⃣ Model Evaluation
•	Evaluate using R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
•	Compare models and identify the best performer.
5️⃣ Visualization
•	Plot actual vs predicted prices.
•	Display feature importance for interpretability.
 Results
•	The model successfully predicts car prices with good accuracy.
•	Among tested models, Random Forest Regressor often performs best due to its ensemble learning capability.
 Real-World Application
This project demonstrates how car dealers and buyers can use machine learning to:
•	Estimate fair market value for used cars.
•	Make informed buying/selling decisions.
•	Reduce price negotiation gaps using data-driven insights.

How to Run
1.	Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in your working directory.
2.	Open the Jupyter Notebook (Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb).
3.	Run the cells step by step.
4.	View results and charts at the end.
Conclusion
This project is a great introduction to machine learning regression, covering everything from data preprocessing to model evaluation. It showcases how predictive analytics can be applied in the automotive industry effectively.
